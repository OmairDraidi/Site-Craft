Graduation Project Assignment: PRD Writing

🎯 Task
You are required to write a Product Requirement Document (PRD) for your graduation project in the Vibe Coding course.
The PRD must be written in Markdown (.md).
It must include at least one Mermaid diagram (flowchart, system design, or user journey).
It must include at least one HTML block (e.g., table, card, styled text).
Using Mermaid + HTML will make your PRD professional and visual.

✅ Requirements

1. Project Idea
Your project idea must be clear and explained in 3–5 sentences.
We recommend building a website (Django + React suggested), but you may propose other ideas if you can justify them.
2. PRD Content (Minimum Sections)
Project Overview – what is your project about?
Target Users – who will benefit from it?
Core Features – list at least 5.
System/Process Flow – represented in a Mermaid diagram.
UI/UX Concept – shown with an HTML block.
3. Tools for Serving the PRD
You can use Node.js with Docsify, VitePress, or MkDocs to preview your Markdown with Mermaid + HTML rendered.
